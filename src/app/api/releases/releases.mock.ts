    about: `“Life Is About Making Memories” is Zoomoid's first proper album release. It features 11 tracks, a proper intro and outro, and tries to hit those nostalgia notes, with tracks thematically and sonically covering video games, movies, tv series, and moments from childhood in the early 2000s, when things were simpler and he had to care less.`,

    about: `“In <b>December, 2018</b>, returning from a night of party in Münster, Germany, via train, I travelled through several stations I never had been to before.
    The <b>charismatic voice of Ingo Ruff</b>, freshly fallen snow that covered lonely fields along the way, and a slight hangover of the tequila from the previous
    night lead to the idea to make an EP from numberous impressions saved from years of using public transport almost every weekend.

    The idea got burried in a notebook for a year until I picked it up and sketched a trip on my usual train route through some cities in NRW.

    It's real, it's honest, <b>it's got sharp edges</b> and it's certainly different to my other work in that year. Yet, it's a favourite of <b>a lot of people for exactly that reason.</b>”
