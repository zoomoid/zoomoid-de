          This is where it all begins. The introduction. The thought of all that
          could have been.

        <p>
          &ldquo;All That Could Have Been&rdquo; is an homage to all those
          intros to albums I've written &mdash; something that I always thought
          I was rather good at.
        </p>,
        <p>
          For just a moment in the beginning of 2023, I felt so amazing.
          Floating above the clouds is an incredible feeling.
        </p>,
        <p>
          All those endorphines pushed me through the first months of the year.
          They would fade too quickly...

          ...and in the blink of an eye, I was back in the deep dark hole. All
          that came crashing down. It was never built to last. Time flew by and
          I found myself back in old habits.

        <p>
          &ldquo;Nur F端r Einen Augenblick&rdquo; is older than these experiences
          though. It was originally written back in 2022, on a rare evening of
          inspiration and creativity. It had many different working titles
          throughout its design period: &ldquo;What&apos;s Next&rdquo; was one
          of them, and I think it already captures the spirit of the entire
          album in some sense.
        </p>,
        <p>
          It&apos;s an uplifting kind of track, in its core a Drum &amp; Bass
          song that heavily leans into orchestral music (which is where most of
          the instruments usually belong). It&apos;s inspired by the works of
          artists like Keeno and Etherwood.

          &ldquo;Ein Tag Im April&rdquo;, or &ldquo;a day in April&rdquo; spans
          a bridge between &ldquo;Nur F端r Einen Augenblick&rdquo; and
          &ldquo;Angst vor der Zukunft&rdquo;. It&apos;s a wild ride, an
          experience, like a day in my life in that particular month.

          Between ups and downs, between running 21 kilometers on a random
          saturday in pouring rain for the sheer reason of feeling the
          runner&apos;s high, feeling weightless, feeling so much, and crashing
          down completely while in Amsterdam.

          It&apos;s also more than just a single day. A day became the representation of the entire mood
