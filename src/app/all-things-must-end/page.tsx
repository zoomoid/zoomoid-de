      <h2>Zoomoid&apos;s last album</h2>

      <p>
        10 years after getting a second chance at life, which sort of sparked
        the idea for Zoomoid, All Things Must End marks the final step of me as
        Zoomoid as an artist
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;ve come a long way. I&apos;ve learned so much. Made so many great things.
        Made so many mistakes, experienced so much, from failure to success to
        pure gratitude, to meeting people who genuinely liked the bits and
        pieces I made.
      </p>
      <p>This all made me incredibly proud.</p>
      <p>
        But Zoomoid is merely a shadow of my personal life. I&apos;ve experienced a
        lot of trauma, a lot of hard times over the last couple of years. I&apos;ve
        lost several people, and with that, pieces of myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        When my mental health got worse, I distanced myself from reality and
        from myself. That also meant distancing myself from being Zoomoid, the
        artist. It became harder and harder to write and compose new music. I
        took ever-longer breaks from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the idea to finish the project, to finalize things, to bring things
        to a conclusion sparked, I felt relief. As with so many things in these
        current times, I only had to be strong one more time. After that, things
        would be done, I&apos;d be able to let new things enter my life
      </p>
      <p>
        And so I wrote my last album. I tried to capture so many things, so many
        emotions, so many states of mind in tracks, tried to create a holistic
        experience, something that would remain relevant beyond the lifetime of
        Zoomoid.
      </p>
      <p>I think, for once, at least in some part, I succeeded.</p>
      <p>
        All Things Must End is my last album. What comes afterwards is pretty
        much left to time. Conincidentally, a great motive of the album -- Time.
      </p>
      <p>
        That does&apos;nt mean that I&apos;m never going to write music again. It just
        marks the ending of Zoomoid. The final chapter. Such that a new book can
        begin.
